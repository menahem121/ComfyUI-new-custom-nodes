## 1) Intro
A more advanced version of the [original node](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/fe01885acf892de636b1b2743903812099bd42e3/comfy_extras/nodes_post_processing.py#L249)
- Outputs both width and height
- Allows you to set the "multiple_of" for the width/height pair (e.g., use 16 for 16-channel VAEs)
- Set "megapixels = 0" to disable megapixel scaling
